# ConvexHull

The goal of this project is to compare time complexities of convex hull algorithm implementations in different input scenarios.
The convex Hull Algorithms to be tested are:
 - QuickHull
 - brute force
 - Monotone Chain (Andrew)
 - Graham Scan
 - Jarvis March

The different input data scenarios to be tested are:
 - Random data
 - All points on the convex hull
 - All points inside the convex hull, except four corners
